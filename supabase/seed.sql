    $t$On Friday 25 September the lab brings its work out of the department and into Piazza Umberto I: fiber muscles you can watch contract, and a gripper that picks things up with a charge of electricity. For all ages, until late.$t$,
    $t$The RoboPhysics Laboratory takes part in the European Researchers' Night 2026, in the gazebo set up in Piazza Umberto I in Bari, on Friday 25 September from 15:00 to 22:00.

Two of the lab's technologies will be there to be seen and handled. The first is the electrofluidic fiber muscles: fibers barely two millimetres thick that contract when an electrical impulse circulates the liquid inside them, reaching force, contraction and speed comparable to those of human muscle.

The second is gripping by electroadhesion — a kind of suction cup that needs no vacuum: a small electrical charge is enough to make it stick to surfaces of any shape, from a flat sheet to a piece of fruit.

The activity is open to all ages, with no booking. Vito Cacucciolo and Nicola Creanza are there for the lab, with the Department of Mechanics, Mathematics and Management of Politecnico di Bari.$t$,

    $t$The RoboPhysics Laboratory hosted Dr. Masahiro Nakade, First Secretary and Science & Technology Attaché at the Embassy of Japan in Italy.

The visit was an occasion to introduce the laboratory and show the work as it stands: the research lines currently running, the technologies developed here, and the scientific problems that are shaping them. Seeing the devices in person tends to make the questions sharper than any presentation does.

What made the conversation worth having was the interest in how the Italian and Japanese research ecosystems might connect — where the two overlap, and where a collaboration would actually add something. Meetings like this one are how those possibilities start: not with an agreement, but with people in a room who understand each other's work.

    'Life at RPL',
    $t$The whole lab left the benches behind for two days on the Lao river, in the Pollino National Park: working sessions under the trees, rafting, and time to decide together where the lab is heading.$t$,
    $t$For two days in July the RoboPhysics Laboratory moved out of the department and into Laino Borgo, on the Lao river in the Pollino National Park.

The format was deliberately simple: long tables under the trees, paper and markers instead of screens, and a schedule with enough space in it to let conversations run. The sessions asked the questions that never quite fit into an ordinary week — how the group works together, what each research line needs next, and what the lab should look like a few years from now. PhD students, postdocs and MSc students all took the floor, which is harder to arrange in a corridor than around a table by a river.

Between sessions came the other half of the point. The group ran the rapids of the Lao with Pollino Rafting, walked up to the waterfall, and ate together at the long table well into the evening. Sharing a raft turns out to be a fast way to learn how a team distributes effort.

The retreat has become a fixed appointment in the life of the lab: a way of remembering that a research group is a group of people first, and that some of the best thinking happens a long way from the instruments.$t$,

    $t$The RoboPhysics Laboratory student team took first place at the IEEE RoboSoft 2026 competition in Kanazawa, Japan, competing against university teams from across the international soft-robotics community.

The winning entry was a manipulation system built on technologies developed in the lab: fluidic actuators driven by electro-active fluids, paired with electroadhesive gripping surfaces. The system had to grasp, move and release objects of very different shape, weight and fragility — the kind of task where rigid grippers force a trade-off between force and delicacy.

The team was led on the technical side by Angelo Catalano and included MSc students Elisabetta Annese, Luca Mitaritonna and Giuseppe Macchia, each of whom brought a thesis strand into the build: soft manipulation, electroadhesive grippers and fluidic-actuator control.$t$,

    $t$With the MIT Media Lab we present a new class of fiber-format artificial muscles: electric, silent and free of external pumps, with power density comparable to skeletal muscle.$t$,
    $t$Our work with the MIT Media Lab on electrofluidic fiber muscles is out in Science Robotics.

The paper introduces a class of artificial muscles in fiber format that integrates charge-injection fiber pumps and thin McKibben actuators into a single closed fluidic circuit. Because the pump lives inside the muscle, the system needs no external compressor and no tubes running off-body: it is electric, silent and untethered.

The central finding concerns bias pressure. By pre-pressurising the circuit, the modular muscles reach a power density comparable to that of skeletal muscle — the benchmark the field has been chasing for decades. Woven in antagonistic pairs, one fiber contracts while the other extends, reproducing the biceps–triceps arrangement of the human arm.

The work is authored by Ozgun Kilic Afsar, Gabriele Pupillo, Gennaro Vitucci, Wedyan Babatain, Hiroshi Ishii and Vito Cacucciolo, with the support of the European Research Council.$t$,

RoboFluid asks what becomes possible when the pump stops being external hardware and becomes part of the machine's own body. The project runs along four lines: fluidic artificial muscles in fiber format, haptic gloves for telemanipulation, thermoregulating clothing with woven fluidic circuits, and low-cost robotic hands driven by muscle fibers.

The grant established the RoboPhysics Laboratory in its current form and funds the PhD positions and postdoctoral research now working across those lines.$t$,
